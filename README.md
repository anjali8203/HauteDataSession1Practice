Hi! This is the repo for the introductory session I held where I discussed basic Data Wrangling and the basics of Github. 

The link to the video is here: https://youtu.be/Ae8-AdEVYeg

Unfortunately, I did not start the recording until about 10 minutes in (and that's my bad), but I tried to go over everything I said in the first 10 minutes. 

Enjoy!
